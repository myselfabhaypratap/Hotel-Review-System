# Hotel-Review-System


Hotel Review System
This is a simple Hotel Review System implemented in Java. The system allows users to view information about hotels, including average ratings and reviews. Users can also sort hotels based on their average ratings.

How to Use
Run the program.
Choose options from the menu:
View all hotels: Displays a list of all hotels with their average ratings.
View hotel reviews: Allows users to enter a hotel name and see the reviews for that hotel.
Sort hotels by average rating: Sorts the hotels based on their average ratings in descending order.
Exit: Exits the program.
Sample Data
Two sample hotels, each with reviews, are included to demonstrate the system's functionality. You can customize and expand the data based on your needs.

Classes
Hotel Class
Represents a hotel and contains methods for adding reviews, calculating average ratings, and retrieving information about the hotel.

Review Class
Represents a review and stores information such as user, rating, and comments.

HotelReviewSystem Class
Contains the main logic of the program, including the menu, user input handling, and methods for viewing hotels, reviews, and sorting hotels.

Note
This is a basic console-based application and does not include a database. In a real-world scenario, you would likely use a database to store hotel and review information.

Feel free to modify and extend the code according to your requirements. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Enjoy using the Hotel Review System!
